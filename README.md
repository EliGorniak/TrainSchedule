  # Train Schedule
  
  Train Schedule is a dynamic application created to allows users to incorporate some informations about trains, like name, destination, frequency, etc, and it will see what time will be the next arrival and how many minutes remain until the next ride.

Visit the page here: https://eligorniak.github.io/TrainSchedule/.

  # How the page works
  When the page is loaded, you can see a table with the informations about the train.
  In the form, set all the informations about your train line:
  - Train Name
  - Destination
  - First Train Time (in military time)
  - Frequency (in minutes)
  Click on the Submit button and the application will calculate the time of the next arrival and how many minutes you need to wait until the next arrival.

  # How this page was developed
  The page was made using basicaly HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  For the input datas, the localforage dB was used to create the table of contents (all the train information).
  The functionality of date datas was made with Moment.js.

  Hope you enjoy it!
